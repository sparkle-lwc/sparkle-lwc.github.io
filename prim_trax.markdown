`Trax-L-17` (pronounced "T-rax") is a tweakable block cipher operating on a large 256-bit block. It applies a 256-bit key and 128-bit tweak. To the best of our knowledge, the only
other large tweakable block cipher is `Threefish` which was used as a building for
the SHA-3 candidate [Skein](https://www.schneier.com/academic/skein/). Unlike this cipher, `Trax-L-17` uses 32-bit words that
are better suited for vectorized implementation as well as on micro-controllers.
Another improvement of `Trax-L-17` over `Threefish` is the fact that we provide strong bounds for the probability of all linear trails and all (related-tweak) differential trails. Because of its Substitution-Permutation Network structure, `Trax` is indeed inherently easier to analyze. Such a large tweakable block cipher can provide robust authenticated encryption, meaning that it can retain a high security level even in case of nonce misuse or in the presence of quantum adversaries, as argued in [Saturnin specification](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/round-2/spec-doc-rnd2/saturnin-spec-round2.pdf). The performance penalty of such guarantees can be minimized using vectorization and/or parallelism.

A tweakable block cipher lends itself well to a parallelizable mode of operation
such as [Î˜CB](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21702-9_18), a variant of OCB which saves its complex overhead needed to
turn a regular block cipher into a tweakable one. Since our block size is equal to
256 bits, attacks relying on collisions obtained via the birthday paradox are non-
issue with `Trax-L-17`. Some modes such as the [Synthetic Counter-in-Tweak](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-53018-4_2)
can retain a security level up to the birthday bound in case of nonce misuse. As
suggested in [Saturnin specification](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/documents/round-2/spec-doc-rnd2/saturnin-spec-round2.pdf), using a 256-bit block cipher can also help providing post-
quantum security in cases where the attacker is given a lot of power (e.g. if the
primitive runs on a quantum computer).

## Description

The following figure captures the high-level structure of one step in `Trax-L`. Here, $$A_c$$ denotes the ARX-box [Alzette](/alzette) with the constant $$c$$; $$\ell'$$ is a linear bijection of $$(\mathbb{F}_2^{16})^4$$ defined as 

$$
\ell'(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) = (z_4, z_3 \oplus z_4, z_2, z_1 \oplus z_2).

## Performance

In summary, Trax-L-17 can be used in SCT mode to provide 128 bits of
security in case of nonce-misuse, and its large block size can frustrate some
quantum attacks when used in the same mode as `Saturnin`: it can be used to
offer a very robust authenticated encryption. On a Cortex-M3 microcontroller,
the generation of subkeys, encryption, and decryption has an execution time
of 925, 2435, and 2464 clock cycles, respectively. These results are based on a
standard C implementation, whereby we determined the execution times with
help of the cycle-accurate instruction set simulator of Keil Microvision v5.24.2
using a generic Cortex-M3 model as target device. For comparison, the currently
fastest implementation of `Saturnin` has a (simulated) encryption time of 5494
cycles and a decryption time of 5489 cycles on a generic Cortex-M3 device. 10
Consequently, `Trax-L-17` outperforms `Saturnin` by a factor of more than 2.2.

The use of 32-bit operations implies that it is possible to vectorize the com-
putation of several parallel Trax-L-17 instances on many platforms, meaning
that its speed can be multiplied whenever e.g. AVX instructions are available.
